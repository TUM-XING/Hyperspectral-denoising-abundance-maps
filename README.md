# Hyperspectral imaging microscopy data set algorithms for layer number mapping of two-dimensional materials
This algorithm deals with the data processing methods using the hyperspectral data sets of 2D materials for atomic layer mapping.
The MATLAB algorithms for visualizing single-band images, denoising hyperspectral data set, extracting specific end members, and calculating abundance maps of each end member.
